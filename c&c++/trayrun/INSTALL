Installation Procedure

To install TrayRun the executable TrayRun.exe needs to be copied to the Windows
folder (e.g. C:\WINDOWS or C:\WINNT). The setup takes care of this.

Applying TrayRun
================

Create a shortcut to the program you wish to run on startup and place it in
in the Starup folder in the Start Menu. Next, change the shortcut by
prepending the command TrayRun to the Target.
